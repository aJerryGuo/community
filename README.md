To start your Phoenix server:

  * build Docker image with `docker-compose build`
  * Create and migrate database with `docker-compose run web mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint in Docker with `docker-compose up`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
